          <h4>Reddit 2.0</h4>
            <strong>Reddit 2.0</strong> was created alongside Evan Epperson and Hunter Wallen using React, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL and is deployed on Heroku using version control via Github.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We aimed to create a clone of Reddit and began with the simple process of making a functional message board. We then added user authentication, which was a big part of the functionality of the app, so that users have a different experience when they are logged in vs. the public interface. We integrated many features of the original Reddit application, including subreddits that are public and private, the ability to edit and delete one's posts, popular communities, popular redditors, and a couple advertisements.

              <h4>Decolonize My Audition Book</h4>
              <strong>Decolonize My Audition Book</strong> was built using JavaScript, Express, Node, Mongo, and MongoDB Atlas. This full stack application was designed for musical theater actors who are Black, Indigenous, and people of color.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              A classic must-have for MT performers is "a book," or a collection of songs –– some abbreviated into 16-bar and 32-bar cuts –– that is brought with them to every single audition. To combat the overwhelmingly saturated pool of white writers, and inspired by a post by Yvonne Moss in the Facebook group Theater Folx of Color in which she asked for composer/lyricist recommendations in an effort to "decolonize her audition book," I set out to create a crowd-sourced database of musical theater writers of color.

              <h4>Trips On Trips</h4>
              <strong>Trips On Trips</strong> was created with Eric Culley using React, Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, and JavaScript and is deployed on Heroku using version control via Github.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              We set out to create a "bulletin board" of dream vacations to take once the COVID vaccine is widely in effect across the world. Users can can create new trips in the "Add a Trip" box, as well as upload images directly from their device without having to use a URL. Other users can leave a comment on a post by entering their name and the comment, and comments are displayed with the most recent ones listed first.

              <h4>Jacket Horoscope</h4>
              <strong>Jacket Horoscope</strong> was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Users can input their zip code into the delightfully simply interface, and the app returns an answer to that age-old question: "What jacket do I wear today?" I collaborated with visual artist Stephanie Blanck on the drawings, which I wanted to feel fun, silly, and childlike. Depending on where the user is in the United States, they might receive a "sleeping bag" coat, a hoodie, a denim jacket, or even a T-shirt (try entering a Hawaii zip code for that response!).
